14) A)'2' > 1 = true                          Comparing 2 int

    E)true == 2 = false                       true = 1 != 2
    F)true === Boolean(2) = true      

15) == is an equality with possibility to compare diffÃ©rents types values like comparing a number in a string and an int
    === is a true equality considering types

16) In the part2-question16.js file

17) The output is [ 2, 4, 6 ] because the funtion loop in the array and apply a function on it. Both array and function are putted in parameter. Here the function placed in parameter return the double of the value placed in parameter, so the array is doubled.
